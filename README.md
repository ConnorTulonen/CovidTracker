Machine learning
The machine learning part of the program is implements via neural network (ML.py).
The weights have already been calculated using a separate file (â€˜machinelearning.py)
Fourier Transform
Given that the program needs to considers audio files of coughs a Fourier transform is implemented (fourier.py). All sound data was provided via freesound.org.
Api
The api (newapi.py) retrieves data from the server and analyzing producing a demo webpage
